This is a Python library and associated tools to aid in playing Factorio.

This requires [lupa](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lupa) to load the Lua data.
The server requires [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to serve data. If you have
no experience with Flask, running `python server.py` will start a local server
on port 5000 for testing. The index page contains a listing of the pages I've
accessed the most frequently.

Not tested on any platform other than Linux.
